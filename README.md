### Installation

[Install rEFInd](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html) as you would normally.

Create  `themes` folder in /refined/ paste the contents there,
in /refined edit `refind.conf` and add this as the last line include  `include themes/custom/theme.conf `


You can add icons if you want custom ones.


You'll also want to edit the [background image](./background.png).
