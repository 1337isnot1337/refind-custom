### Installation

[Install rEFInd](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html) as you would normally.

Create  `themes` folder in /refined/ paste the contents there.

in /refined edit `refind.conf` and add this as the last line include  `include themes/custom/theme.conf `



You can add icons if you want custom ones (icon folders, .png 1280x1280)



You'll also want to edit the [background image](./background.png).
